h2. An example app showcasing Spy

h3. Gem Requirements

This app relies on the following gems:

* gem 'rails', '3.0.0.beta4'

* gem 'rails', :git => 'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'

* gem 'devise', :git => 'git://github.com/plataformatec/devise.git'

* gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require => 'sqlite3'

* gem 'spy', :git => 'git://github.com/jackdempsey/spy.git'

* bundler (1.0.0.beta.5)

h3. Getting Started

<code>

# bundle install
# rake db:seed
# rails s

</code>

At this point you should be able to go to http://localhost:3000 and view the app. The various accounts you can test with are:

* admin@test.com / test1234
* test1@test.com / test1234
* test2@test.com / test1234

Give the admin and one of the test users a shot. You'll see various messages change as a result, and when you're logged in 
as the admin, you should see the Spy middleware kick into gear.
